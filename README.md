# Python Neural Network Playground (WIP)
Google's Neural Network Playground in Python

Original: https://playground.tensorflow.org

## Getting Started
This project is written in Python 3.6 and based on wxPython GUI.

With an Keras DL library I'm highly recommand you to use Tensorflow as backend.

## Run
```
python3 main.py
```
Waiting for you all to improve it
